clojure-markdown
================

A practice project of clojure(http://clojure.org). Not sure I can make it finally.

#### What I have done

* Find `em` and `strong` groups in a line, only support `*` style.
* Parse `strong` and `em` tags. Only support `*` form for now.
* Find links with form `[text](url title)` form.
